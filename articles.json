            "aiReadableSummary": "Title: The Housing Recession Is Over, According to Top Real Estate Economist\n\nSummary:\nAccording to Lawrence Yun, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the US housing recession has come to an end. NAR data released in June showed a 0.3% increase in pending home sales compared to the previous month. The presence of multiple offers indicates that housing demand is outpacing supply. Yun mentioned that homebuilders are increasing production and hiring workers to meet the demand. Despite the recent increase, the Pending Home Sales Index remains 15.6% lower than the previous year. The NAR predicts an increase in the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to reach 6.4% this year, which has led to current homeowners with lower rates being reluctant to move and has sidelined many house hunters. Moody's researchers also noted that higher rates will continue to impact homebuyers for years to come. The NAR projects a slight increase in the unemployment rate, from 3.7% to 4.1% in the next year. If mortgage rates decline, Yun suggests that a rush of buyers may occur later in the year and into the next. However, tight housing inventory has hindered improvements in affordability, as home prices have climbed for four consecutive months, with all major metro markets reporting monthly price gains. The Federal Reserve recently announced a 25 basis-point rate hike, and it is expected to be the final adjustment of the year before easing begins in 2024.\n\nKey Points:\n- Lawrence Yun, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), declares the end of the US housing recession.\n- NAR data shows a 0.3% increase in pending home sales in June compared to the previous month.\n- The presence of multiple offers suggests higher housing demand and a lack of supply.\n- Homebuilders are increasing production and hiring workers to meet the growing demand.\n- Despite the recent increase, the Pending Home Sales Index remains significantly lower (-15.6%) than the previous year.\n- The NAR predicts a rise in the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to 6.4% this year, leading to reluctant homeowners and sidelined house hunters.\n- Moody's researchers note that higher rates will continue to impact homebuyers.\n- The unemployment rate is projected to increase from 3.7% to 4.1% in the next year.\n- A decline in mortgage rates could lead to a rush of buyers later in the year.\n- Tight housing inventory has prevented improvements in affordability, as home prices have climbed for four consecutive months.\n- The Federal Reserve recently announced a 25 basis-point rate hike, expected to be the final adjustment of the year before easing begins in 2024.\n\nKey Terms:\n- Lawrence Yun\n- National Association of Realtors (NAR)\n- Pending home sales\n- Housing recession\n- Housing demand\n- Lack of supply\n- Homebuilders\n- Production increase\n- Mortgage rates\n- Homeowners\n- House hunters\n- Moody's researchers\n- Unemployment rate\n- Affordability\n- Home prices\n- Federal Reserve\n- Rate hike\n\nKey Takeaways:\n- The US housing recession has ended, according to NAR's chief economist.\n- Despite a slight increase in pending home sales, it remains lower than the previous year.\n- Lack of supply and high mortgage rates have impacted housing demand.\n- Homebuilders are working to meet the increased demand.\n- Rising mortgage rates will continue to affect homebuyers.\n- Unemployment rates are expected to rise slightly.\n- A decline in mortgage rates could stimulate the housing market.\n- Tight housing inventory has hindered affordability.\n- The Federal Reserve's recent rate hike is expected to be the last for the year."
