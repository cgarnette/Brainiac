// Maybe once a week in a random channel we have a draft. Stealing this idea from the midnight boys.
// The draft will be based on something related to the channel.

// Like in the sports channel you can draft an NBA team from across history.
// Users then vote on whose response they like best. Can debate or whatever they wish
// We'll keep track of who wins using points similar to trivia. This can be in a separate database if we choose to do so.
